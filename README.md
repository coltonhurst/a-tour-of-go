# A Tour of Go

This repository contains code & comments from the official [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org).

As long as you have the Go environment set up on your machine, you can build/run each file as so: `go build filename.go`. The files are just arranged individually, so if you import the repo into your GOPATH src/ folder, linters may complain that you have more than one `main()` func. Just ignore it and compile the file individually.
