/*
	Notes 3.9

	'mutual exclusion'- allowing goroutines to only access a variable one at a time
	to prevent conflicts. Uses the data structure called a 'mutex'

	Go's standard lib provides mutual exclusion via sync.Mutex (has methods Lock and Unlock).

	We can execute a block of code in mutual exclusion by surrounding it with Lock and Unlock
	(see the Inc method).

	You can also use the defer method to ensure the mutex is unlocked (see the Value method).
