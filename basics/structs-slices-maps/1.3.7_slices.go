/*
	Notes 1.3.6

	- A slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array
	- Slices are more common than arrays in practice
	- Specify a slice like this: a[low : high]
		It excludes the end (high)
	- The difference between arrays and slices when declared are subtle;
	  if there is a size specified, it's an array.
